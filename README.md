# Welcome to Gator
A CLI RSS reader that just about barely works.
But it works. And that's what matters.

# Installation

## Dependencies
Gator depends on PostgreSQL and goose to bring the database up. You also need a ```.gatorconfig.json``` file in your home directory (```~/```).

Install PostgreSQL with your favorite package manager. If you're using Linux, I assume you know how. If you're on MacOS, use brew. The application
was built on version 17, which you can install with ```brew install postgresql@17``` and then start with ```brew services start postgresql@17```.

You then need something called goose to bring the database up.
